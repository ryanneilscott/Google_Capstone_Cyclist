This is project #1 of the Google Data Analytics Capstone. 

I was provided with 12 months of data for a fictional bikeshare company

The question is 'How do casual riders and members use a bike share differently?' 

The following is how I cleaned the data provided using Structured Query Language (SQL) code.

SELECT 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM started_at) AS Hour,

    COUNT(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'member' THEN started_at ELSE NULL END) AS Member_Riders,
    
    COUNT(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'casual' THEN started_at ELSE NULL END) AS Casual_Riders

FROM `annular-net-337304.Cyclist_Bike_Share.2020_12` 

WHERE start_station_name IS NOT NULL

GROUP BY Hour

ORDER BY Hour
