This is project #1 of the Google Data Analytics Capstone. 

I was provided with 12 months of data for a fictional bikeshare company

The question is 'How do casual riders and members use a bike share differently?'

--Select the data query

SELECT *

FROM `annular-net-337304.Cyclist_Bike_Share.2020_12`

WHERE start_station_id IS NOT NULL

--Total Riders, Number of Member and Casual riders, and Percentages


SELECT 
    COUNT(member_casual) AS Total_Riders,
    
    COUNT(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'member' THEN started_at ELSE NULL END) AS Member_Riders,
    
    COUNT(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'casual' THEN started_at ELSE NULL END) AS Casual_Riders,
    
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'member' THEN started_at ELSE NULL END) / 
    COUNT(member_casual), 2) * 100 AS Member_Percent,

    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'casual' THEN started_at ELSE NULL END) / 
    (COUNT(member_casual)), 2) * 100 AS Casual_Percent

FROM `annular-net-337304.Cyclist_Bike_Share.2020_12` 

WHERE start_station_name IS NOT NULL;

*/

From this query, I was able to determine that members made up 78 percent of the 119874 riders, 
while casual riders made up the remaining 22 percent

--This shows us at what hours over the course of a month during the day Members and Casual riders used Cyclist Bike Share the most


SELECT 
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM started_at) AS Hour,

    COUNT(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'member' THEN started_at ELSE NULL END) AS Member_Riders,
    
    COUNT(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'casual' THEN started_at ELSE NULL END) AS Casual_Riders

FROM `annular-net-337304.Cyclist_Bike_Share.2020_12` 

WHERE start_station_name IS NOT NULL

GROUP BY Hour

ORDER BY Hour;

*/

From this query, I was able to export the data onto a spreadsheet and create line graphs as a
visualization to determine if there were time where one group of riders were more likely to 
use the bike share.

--Select the number of riders using each start station to determine which stations were most popular amongst members and casual riders

SELECT 
    start_station_id AS Start_Station_Num,
    
    COUNT(start_station_id) AS Num_of_Riders, 
    
    COUNT(CASE WHEN member_casual = 'member'

WHERE start_station_name IS NOT NULL 

GROUP BY start_station_id

ORDER BY num_of_riders DESC;

*/

With this query, I was able to determine the most popular starting stations amongst riders and 
the number of members and casual riders who frequented these stations.

*/

From this query, I was able to determine the most popular bike option amonst bike riders (Classic
Bike), the most popular bike used by members (the classic bike), the most popular bike used by
casual riders (the electric bike), and the least used bike by both users (the dockable bike).
