# Google_Capstone_Projects
This repository contains the code for my capstone projects from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

As part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, we were provided an optional capstone project at the end of
the curriculum. The project was a culmination of the skills gained over the course of the program, including spreadsheets, 
Structured Query Language (SQL), R, and Tableau.

Students are provided with data and a business question. I received data from an imaginary bike share company and was asked
the question, "How do members and casual riders use the bike share differently?"

I used SQL and Google Sheets for my analysis.

Upon completetion of my analysis, I had determined:

- Members are primarily using Cyclist Bike Share during the Monday through Friday work week, with large number of members using
  bikes between 5am and 8am, as well as 3pm and 5pm.
- Casual riders primarily use our products during the weekend and during the summer months of June, July, and August.
- Of riders that chose to use the Docked Bike option, 98% of riders were casual riders.
