# Google_Capstone_Cyclist
SQL Project
This repository contains the code for my capstone projects from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

As part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, we were provided an optional capstone project at the end of the curriculum. The project was a culmination of the skills gained over the course of the program, including spreadsheets, Structured Query Language (SQL), R, and Tableau.

Students are provided with data and a business question. I received data from an imaginary bike share company and was asked the question, "How do members and casual riders use the bike share differently?"

I used SQL and Google Sheets for my analysis.

Upon completetion of my analysis, I had determined:

- The most popular starting stations amongst riders and the number of members and casual riders who frequented these stations

- The most popular bike option amonst bike riders (Classic Bike), the most popular bike used by members (the classic bike), the most popular bike used by casual riders (the electric bike), and the least used bike by both users (the dockable bike)

- Members used the bike share more consistently throughout the year, while casual riders were more likely to use the bike share as the year grew closer the the summer months
